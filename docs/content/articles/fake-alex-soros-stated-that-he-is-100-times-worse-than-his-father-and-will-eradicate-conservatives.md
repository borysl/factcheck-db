There is [information](https://www.discred.ru/2023/06/14/ya-v-sto-raz-huzhe-papy-naslednik-sorosa-vyhodit-iz-teni/) circulating online that Alex Soros, the son of George Soros, allegedly claimed that he is 100 times worse than his father. It is also claimed that Alex Soros vowed to eradicate conservatives from the internet.

**However, Alex Soros did not make such statements.**

On June 11, 2023, it was [announced](https://www.wsj.com/articles/george-soros-heir-son-alexander-soros-e3c4ca13) that Alex Soros became the Chairman of the Open Society Foundations’ Board of Directors. He is the successor to his 92-year-old father, George Soros.

The original source of the fake quote attributed to Alex Soros is an article from [The People’s Voice](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/alex-soros-vows-to-eradicate-conservatives-from-the-internet-im-100-times-worse-than-my-dad/) titled “Alex Soros Vows To Eradicate Conservatives From the Internet: “I’m 100 Times Worse Than My Dad”. The article states that “Alex Soros has vowed to censor conservatives and independent journalists online “100 times more aggressively” than his father George Soros”. The People’s Voice cites an [interview](https://www.wsj.com/articles/george-soros-heir-son-alexander-soros-e3c4ca13) with Alex Soros for The Wall Street Journal.

Media Bias/Fact Check, a resource that aggregates ratings from independent fact-checkers in the IFCN network, states that [The People’s Voice](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-punch/) promotes biased, unverified information.

In reality, in the interview with The Wall Street Journal, Alex Soros [stated](https://www.wsj.com/articles/george-soros-heir-son-alexander-soros-e3c4ca13) that he is more political than his father. **However, Alex Soros did not claim to be 100 times worse or more aggressive than his father, nor did he express intentions to “eradicate” or censor conservatives.** Instead, Alex Soros mentioned his plans to financially support ideas typically associated with the left, such as abortion rights and improving electoral rights. Specifically, he is assisting Democrats in reaching out to Latino voters and increasing African-American voter turnout. He also emphasized the importance of being more patriotic and considering different perspectives, stating, “If someone voted for Trump, it doesn’t mean they’re lost or a racist”.
