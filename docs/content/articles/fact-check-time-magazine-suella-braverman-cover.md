**Verdict: False**

This image is digitally fabricated. A spokesperson for Time Magazine confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that the image is not an authentic cover.

**Fact Check:** 

 

New U.K. Prime Minister was privately warned by Conservative MPs who have been concerned about Braverman’s views on certain policies, according to the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/afc7a4b7-6cfa-499d-86ce-41e1766591a7). The Home Secretary was accused of “discriminating” against Albanian immigrants from the country’s Prime Minister, Edi Rama, [The Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/suella-braverman-accused-of-discriminating-against-albanians-by-countrys-prime-minister_uk_63628dd0e4b046b39ca3d94f) reported.

The Facebook photo allegedly shows a cover from Time Magazine showing Braverman with a swastika around her neck, bloody hands and black eyes. The image along with the sub-headlines suggest Braverman is evil with emphasis on words “invading” and “hateful.”  “Cruella Braverman,” the headline reads.

“I’m all for satire,” the caption reads. “But the hatred aimed at Suella Braverman is getting off the scale. The swastika, the blood, the black eyes, the ‘othering’… the SS would be proud of this.”

 

This image is digitally fabricated. The cover cannot be found in an [archive](https://time.com/vault/) of Time Magazine’s previous covers. TIME [social](https://www.instagram.com/time/?hl=en) [media](https://twitter.com/time) does not feature the image either.

The image contains a parody disclaimer in small text on the bottom right corner that reads “a SIRHAIRYPOPPINS parody issue.” The image originated from a satirical [Twitter account](https://mobile.twitter.com/SirHairyPoppins/status/1587411787653300225). 

“This image is not an authentic TIME cover,” A spokesperson for Time magazine said in an email to Check Your Fact. [(**RELATED:** **Did Time Magazine Publish A Cover Featuring Kenyan Politician Raila Odinga?)**](https://checkyourfact.com/2022/08/19/fact-check-time-magazine-ralia-odingha/)

This is not the first time a doctored cover has gone viral. Check Your Fact previously [debunked](https://checkyourfact.com/2022/10/31/fact-check-germany-zelenskyy-ukraine-war/) a cover with a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
