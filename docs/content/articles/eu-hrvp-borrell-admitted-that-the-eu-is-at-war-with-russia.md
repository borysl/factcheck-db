DISINFO: EU HRVP Borrell admitted that the EU is at war with Russia
===================================================================

### SUMMARY

Borrell forces the inhabitants of Europe to continue this war.

Borrell emphasised that Europe is not fighting for Ukraine, but against Russia. Borrell's statement itself is a sincere confession.

There are a lot of such statements. Borrell sometimes has revelations in the form of a 'blooming garden' surrounded by 'jungle'.

### RESPONSE

Another example of pro-Kremlin attacks against the EU leadership figures. EU High Representative Josep Borrell did not say that the EU is at war with Russia, using the protection of Ukraine as a pretext, as pro-Kremlin outlets pretend.

In May 2022, HRVP Borrell [said](https://www.euronews.com/2022/05/09/without-this-war-we-were-not-aware-that-europe-is-in-danger) the opposite: "_I don't like at all the story of the West against Russia or the West against the rest...this is an issue about the Charter of the United Nations. It’s about the sovereignty of the people of states, the respect for the borders not to use force to override their neighbour. We are not fighting against Russia. We are defending Ukraine. And, defending Ukraine means to defend the international order based on rules. Otherwise, it will be the law of the jungle"_ he added.

In April 2024, when he called on EU states to create a funding mechanism for the European Defence Agency, Borrell spoke only about the possibility of war in the indefinite future:

"_A full-scale conflict in Europe is “no longer a fantasy_” and Europeans must find new ways to financially prepare for a potentially wider war on the continent, the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell warned. “_War is certainly looming around us (…), and a high-intensity, conventional war in Europe is no longer a fantasy_” Borrell said in a speech at an economic forum in Brussels. “_It \[the war\] is not going to start tomorrow, but we cannot deny reality_,” he said as Euractiv [reports](https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence-and-security/news/europe-needs-more-funds-for-defence-as-wider-war-no-longer-a-fantasy-borrell-warns/).

Russia, which started the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, continuously spreads disinformation narratives, portraying Russia itself as the victim of the [West's aggression](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-west-is-fighting-a-proxy-war-in-ukraine_2/). Furthermore, fabricated threats such as the existence of [biological](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?text=Ukraine%20biological%20weapons) weapons and [dirty bombs](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?text=Ukraine%20dirty%20bomb) in Ukraine, as well as [Nazism in Ukraine](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?text=Ukraine%20nazism), have been advanced as reasons for Russia's aggression of Ukraine.
