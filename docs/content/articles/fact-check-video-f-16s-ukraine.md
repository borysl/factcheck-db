A video [shared on X](https://twitter.com/SythUK/status/1739253169031434291), formerly Twitter, claims to show F-16s in Ukraine.

 

**Verdict: False**

The F-16 in the video was digitally created as part of an ad. While F-16s are being provided to Ukraine, it has not been confirmed that the aircraft are in the country.

**Fact Check:**

 

Russia hit Kyiv with another wave of missiles, killing at least five people and wounding another 130, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/world/europe/missiles-ukraine-war-attack-russia.html). Russia said Ukraine retaliated with missile strikes on Belgorod that the oblast’s governor killed at least one person, the outlet reported.

Social media users are sharing a video of a man entering a hangar with a jet in it, claiming it shows F-16s in Ukraine. One user wrote, “F-16’s are in Ukraine!” **[(RELATED: Here’s What We Know About Israel And The Holy Family Catholic Parish In Gaza)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/12/18/heres-what-we-know-about-israel-and-the-holy-family-catholic-parish-in-gaza/)**

This claim, however, is false. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the video is actually from an advertisement from Aviatsiya Halychyny, a Ukrainian apparel company. The video was posted in November 2023 with the title, “Bomber King of the sky | Aviation of Galicia.”  

 

The advertisement is for the jacket, which is linked in the [video description](https://www.aviatsiyahalychyny.com/men/jacket/kings-of-the-sky/?utm_source=socmedia&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=video-ah) and is featured prominently in the video. The F-16 is also a digital creation, as there are no F-16s in Ukraine in November 2023. The Netherlands announced it would deliver 18 F-16s, though it did not state when the aircraft would be in the country, according to Reuters.

“Yes, we confirm that this is our advertisement and it doesn’t show real F-16,” Liia Zelinska, a content manager for the company, told Check Your Fact in an email.
