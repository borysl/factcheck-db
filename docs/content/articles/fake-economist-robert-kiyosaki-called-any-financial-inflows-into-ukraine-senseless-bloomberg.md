Russian propagandists are spreading [news](https://t.me/sheyhtamir1974/74174) that the American media Bloomberg released a video in which American economist Robert Kiyosaki called investments in Ukraine foolish.

**This is fake. Bloomberg did not publish such a video; the clip was edited from unrelated fragments. Kiyosaki did not speak out against investments in Ukraine.**

The video published by propagandists is not available on Bloomberg’s official channels — [website](https://www.bloomberg.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bloomberg), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bloombergbusiness), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@markets), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bloomberg/). The media releases videos in various formats with slightly different graphic designs for multiple platforms, but none of them use titles in black letters on a white background with the logo in the upper right corner of the screen. Kiyosaki himself did not call investments in Ukraine foolish on his [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RobertKiyosaki), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/therealkiyosaki/) pages.

Propagandists compiled the video from several clips that are unrelated to each other. In particular, using keywords, we managed to find an excerpt from a video featuring Kiyosaki himself. It’s an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHt5Mdr0QFk) from the YouTube channel “Finance With Sharan,” published on September 6, 2023. In it, the speaker discussed current news in finance, politics, and more. Ukraine was mentioned, and Kiyosaki [stated](https://youtu.be/zHt5Mdr0QFk?t=3931) that the United States prints dollars to support Ukraine, so it’s not advisable to keep savings in this currency. The economist did not claim that providing financial aid to Ukraine is foolish.

Propagandists claim that Kiyosaki made this statement at a meeting of the international investment company Traderfriends. This is not true, as [Traderfriends](https://www.traderfriends.de/en) is actually a company that provides educational services on trading. We couldn’t find any evidence that Robert Kiyosaki spoke at their invitation. The latest [publication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwjzMq1R1_I&t=7s) with the economist on the company’s YouTube [page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwjzMq1R1_I&t=7s) dates back to January 14, 2018.

Shortly after the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Kiyosaki expressed [support](https://twitter.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1500604289823256576?s=46&t=HoV4oqNn1TaZMhDhj7EWLg) for Ukraine, stating that if he were in Ukraine, he would also fight for freedom. Regarding the impact of the war on the economy, Kiyosaki [emphasizes](https://twitter.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1503834931461382147?s=46&t=HoV4oqNn1TaZMhDhj7EWLg) that it will push the development of cryptocurrency.
