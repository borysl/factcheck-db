A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AircraftWorld.News/posts/pfbid02j9Ey5XBvZpem95jX3QWbzXxATW4FbJTkUxDXGkfpXn6CgSq1HnfNUF3KWTw13vaEl) purports Tesla CEO Elon Musk is working in conjunction with the U.S. military on a new hypersonic jet to fight in Ukraine.  

**Verdict: False**

 

There is no evidence of the purported claim on either the U.S. Department of Defense’s website or SpaceX’s website. Musk has also never publicly mentioned any such joint project with the U.S. military.

**Fact Check:**

The U.S. purchased 1,330 Starlink terminals from Musk’s aeronautics company SpaceX and delivered them to Ukraine amid the country’s war with Russia, according to [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/08/us-quietly-paying-millions-send-starlink-terminals-ukraine-contrary-spacexs-claims/). As of May, approximately 150,000 people In Ukraine were using the terminals for internet service, [CNBC](https://www.google.com/search?q=spacex+ukraine&oq=spacex+ukraine&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.2108j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) reported.

 

The Facebook post claims Musk and the U.S. military are working on a new hypersonic jet for Ukraine. “Finally: The U.S. & Elon Musk Reveal New Hypersonic Jet To Help Ukraine,” the post’s caption reads.

The post links to an [Aircraft News article](https://fadti.com/937/finally-the-u-s-elon-musk-reveal-new-hypersonic-jet-to-help-ukraine) claiming both parties have entered into a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement (CRADA), which allegedly saw $149 million spent to “build satellites to track missile launches,” the article claims. It then concludes both are ready to unveil a new hypersonic jet to be deployed in Ukraine.

The claim is baseless. There are [no credible news reports](https://www.google.com/search?q=Finally%3A+The+U.S.+%26+Elon+Musk+Reveal+New+Hypersonic+Jet+To+Help+Ukraine&oq=Finally%3A+The+U.S.+%26+Elon+Musk+Reveal+New+Hypersonic+Jet+To+Help+Ukraine&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58j69i61j69i60l2.324j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to suggest that Musk and the U.S. military are working on a hypersonic jet for Ukraine. Likewise, Check Your Fact found no evidence to support the claim on either the [Department of Defense’s (DOD) website](https://search.usa.gov/search?query=Finally:%20The%20U.S.%20&%20Elon%20Musk%20Reveal%20New%20Hypersonic%20Jet%20To%20Help%20Ukraine&affiliate=defensegov&utf8=%26%23x2713%3B) or [SpaceX’s website](https://www.spacex.com/updates/). The claim also does not [appear](https://www.facebook.com/profile/100064688230749/search?q=UNCATEGORIZED%20Finally%3A%20The%20U.S.%20%26%20Elon%20Musk%20Reveal%20New%20Hypersonic%20Jet%20To%20Help%20Ukraine&filters=eyJycF9jcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lOjAiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJjcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lXCIsXCJhcmdzXCI6XCJ7XFxcInN0YXJ0X3llYXJcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIyXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIyLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfeWVhclxcXCI6XFxcIjIwMjJcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIyLTEyXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMi0xLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMi0xMi0zMVxcXCJ9XCJ9IiwiaW50ZXJhY3RlZF9wb3N0czowIjoie1wibmFtZVwiOlwiaW50ZXJhY3RlZF9wb3N0c1wiLFwiYXJnc1wiOlwiXCJ9In0%3D) [on](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22Finally%3A%20The%20U.S.%20%26%20Elon%20Musk%20Reveal%20New%20Hypersonic%20Jet%20To%20Help%20Ukraine%22%20\(from%3ADeptofDefense\)%20lang%3Aen&src=typed_query) [DOD](https://www.instagram.com/deptofdefense/) or SpaceX’s verified [social media](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22Finally%3A%20The%20U.S.%20%26%20Elon%20Musk%20Reveal%20New%20Hypersonic%20Jet%20To%20Help%20Ukraine%22%20\(from%3ASpaceX\)%20lang%3Aen&src=typed_query) [pages](https://www.instagram.com/spacex/).

 

In addition, Musk has never [tweeted](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22Finally%3A%20The%20U.S.%20%26%20Elon%20Musk%20Reveal%20New%20Hypersonic%20Jet%20To%20Help%20Ukraine%22%20\(from%3Aelonmusk\)%20lang%3Aen&src=typed_query) about the purported venture on his verified account. **[(RELATED: Did The U.S. Deploy 12 F-22 Raptors To Ukraine?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2022/08/24/fact-check-f-22-raptors-kharkiv/)**
