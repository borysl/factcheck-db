**Russian media distorted the “quote” attributed to the Turkish president, and the words about the “show” were taken out of context. President Erdogan has consistently said that Turkey opposes encroachments on the territorial integrity of Ukraine and is trying to do everything to bring the parties to a peace agreement.**

[Russian media circulated a distorted quote from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://russian.rt.com/world/news/1006824-erdogan-turciya-ukraina), who allegedly said that his country does not want to get involved in a “Ukraine show.” The story goes on to claim that Turkey has not joined the sanctions against Moscow, and that Russian companies can do business in the country.

The quote at the center of this Russian fake is taken from [President Erdogan’s address to the nation after a Cabinet of Ministers session](https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/gundem/cumhurbaskani-erdogan-yoklama-kacagi-bakaya-genclerimize-bedelli-askerlikten-faydalanabilme-yolunu-aciyoruz/2595498). Erdogan touches on several topics in his address, including the role of Turkey in trying to achieve a ceasefire in Russia’s war against Ukraine.

Looking at the quote in full, it is quite clear that it begins with unambiguous words of support for Ukraine: “In a word, we provided the most serious, concrete and useful support to Ukraine, we clearly stated that we would never accept encroachments on its territorial integrity and right to sovereignty, even in the war north of the Black Sea, about which there are great discussions. We boldly told them about our position, on every platform and at every level, that we continue our relations with Russia,” Erdogan said.

Russian media not only distorted the entire meaning of what the Turkish leader said, they also conveniently omitted Erdogan’s words that Turkey will never accept encroachment on Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

The words about a Ukraine show were wrenched out of context by the Russian media. “President Erdogan emphasized that instead of a show, which in no way helps to resolve the crisis, Turkey is making the most sincere efforts to reach a cease fire in the region, and then to sign a permanent peace agreement, maintaining political and humanitarian relations with Russia” the website aa.com.tr reports.

[Turkey opposes the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, and also expresses support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine](https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/turkey-committed-to-ukraines-territorial-integrity) since the start of the war in eastern Ukraine. After the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine, Turkey repeatedly offered its mediation in organizing negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, and also expressed its readiness to organize a meeting of the presidents of the two countries.
