DISINFO: European countries are starting to betray and disavow Ukraine
======================================================================

### SUMMARY

Why did Ukraine's former allies begin to betray it one after another?

The siege imposed on the Ukrainian border from Poland, the failure of the plan to bring in French troops, the leaking of the conversation of German army officers, the loss of Avdiivka, and the retreat along the entire front, are things that the Kyiv authorities cannot be envied for.

Clearly no one in the EU wants to pay the price. For this reason, today the countries of the Old World are trying to quickly disavow Kyiv and prove that they are for peace.

### RESPONSE

The claim is part of an ongoing pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign concerning Russia’s illegal full-scale [invasion of Ukraine](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?disinfo_keywords%5B%5D=keyword_77110&date=&per_page=). This is part of a wider campaign to erode public support to Ukraine. In this context, it advances the disinformation narrative of [Ukraine as abandoned](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/page/2/?disinfo_keywords%5B0%5D=keyword_77320&_=1702148586032) by its Western allies.

As of March 2024, EU and EU member states' support to Ukraine has totaled around €138 billion (see the infographic [here)](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/eu-solidarity-ukraine/). This can be broken down as follows:

\- €93.3 billion in financial, budget support and humanitarian assistance

\- €17 billion in support for refugees within the EU

\- €28 billion in military support

€53 billion of the €138 billion (38.4%) were provided to Ukraine in the last three months, since December 2023, [when the amount of EU support totaled €85 billion](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/eu-countries-do-not-want-to-support-ukraine-anymore/). This demonstrates that European support to Ukraine has been on an upward trajectory contrary to claims made by pro-Kremlin outlets.
