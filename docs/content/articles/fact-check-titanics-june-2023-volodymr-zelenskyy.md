A photo [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mike.walsh.3110567/posts/10229982105480155) alleges German satirical magazine The Titanic depicted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with his pants down. 

 

**Verdict: False** 

The alleged cover cannot be found in an archive of Titanic Magazine’s recent covers and cannot be found on any of its verified social media accounts.

**Fact Check:** 

 

Zelenskyy recently stated that if the Kremlin loses to Ukraine’s current counteroffensive, Russia will lose the war as a whole, according to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-counteroffensive-zelenskyy-interview-russia-lose-war-rcna89022). Zelenskyy admitted that Ukraine’s offensive has been going “slower than desired,” and stated that the war is not a Hollywood movie with instant results, [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65971790) reported.

The Facebook post purports The Titanic, a German satire magazine, published a cover mocking Zelenskyy. The alleged cover shows the Ukrainian president with his pants being weighed down by a smelly tank.

“Successful counterattack in your own pants,” the alleged cover reads. **[(RELATED: Volodymyr Zelenskyy Wears Symbol Long Associated With Ukrainian Nationalism)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/05/24/fact-check-zelenskyy-symbol-ukrainian-nationalism/)**

 

This is not a genuine cover from Titanic Magazine, however. Check Your Fact found no [credible news reports](https://www.google.com/search?q=successful+counterattack+in+your+own+pants+volodymyr+zelenskyy&biw=1536&bih=722&tbm=nws&sxsrf=APwXEdee4jnxG4X31i7jIHamjxtSwijTXA%3A1687372661659&ei=dUOTZKzHJ9OviLMPl-iImAs&oq=Successful+counterattack+in+your+own+pants+volodymy&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LW5ld3MQARgBMgUIIRCgATIFCCEQoAEyBQghEKABOgUIIRCrAlCBBVinEGCnGmgAcAB4AIABsgGIAcUKkgEEMC4xMJgBAKABAcABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz-news) about such a cover. Although the alleged cover shows “June 2023” in the top right corner, it cannot be found in an [archive](https://www.titanic-magazin.de/archive/heftarchiv/) of recent Titanic Magazine covers. The [genuine](https://www.titanic-magazin.de/heft/2023/juni/) cover for June 2023 does not feature Zelenskyy.

The image cannot be found on the publication’s verified [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TitanicMagazin), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/titanic) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/titanicmagazin/?hl=en) accounts.
