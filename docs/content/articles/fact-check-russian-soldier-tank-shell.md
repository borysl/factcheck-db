A video [shared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/igorsushko/status/1675614023545683968?s=20) claims to show a Russian soldier exploding after hitting a tank with an artillery shell.

 

**Verdict: Misleading**

The explosion is edited in. There is no evidence the soldier died during this.

**Fact Check:**

 

The U.S. is sending cluster munitions to Ukraine as the country is burning through conventional artillery rounds, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/07/07/world/russia-ukraine-news). National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the cluster munitions would be a “bridge” while the U.S. ramps up production of artillery rounds, the outlet reported.

The Twitter video shows a Russian soldier hitting a tank with an artillery shell. He then appears to explode.

However, this explosion is edited in. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the [original video](https://rutube.ru/video/6fd6f7b9e99d833aeb2e4bb553301f9b/) shows the soldier hitting the tread of the tank before putting down the shell and smiling toward a group of men. The video was also shared on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonCredibleDefense/comments/100rhkf/superior_russian_defense_industry_creates/) and does not show an explosion.

 

The explosion was added in by a TikTok effect, according to [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-russia-ukraine-tank-explosion-viral-video-1810792). The outlet reported that the soldier was hitting the tank with the “base of the artillery shell” while the fuze is located in the shell’s tip. **[(RELATED: Did 27,000 Russians Surrender In Ukraine?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/06/30/fact-check-russian-troops-surrender-ukraine/)**

Misinformation around the Russian-Ukrainian war is not new. Check Your Fact recently debunked a video claiming 45,000 Ukrainian troops reached a major Ukrainian city.
