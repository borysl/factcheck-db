A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0332mVcZb2gnaZMTgZM1LqgFdMFVtt9e9CWpVwWJZUXyphEn7QX2NUmqwuKHyrjZZEl&id=100086956327280) purports the U.K. suspended all foreign aid to Ukraine, citing the “severe economic crisis” in the country.

 

**Verdict: False**

The U.K. has not suspended their funding to Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly affirmed his support for Ukraine.

**Fact Check:**

 

Former U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss vowed to continue military aid to Ukraine flowing in September 2022, a month before her resignation, according to [Defense News](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2022/09/20/uk-leader-vows-to-keep-military-aid-flowing-to-ukraine/). Defense Secretary Ben Wallace recently claimed Russian forces were “losing slowly” in the conflict, [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63572502) reported.

The Facebook post claims U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced Britain will no longer support Ukraine. The post does not provide any links or state where or when this was said.

“BREAKING: Britain suspends aid to Ukraine due to financial problems,” the post reads. “Sunak says Britain’s “severe economic crisis” can no longer support aid to Ukraine.”

 

There are [no credible news reports](https://fullfact.org/online/sunak-ukraine-financial-support/?fbclid=IwAR3a7HW6CeeceJXw_HivI65vKNVAjgyn1N1pKrZex_HiC80lRY7ECRpFU0I) suggesting the U.K. will no longer send aid to Ukraine. There are no announcements related to this claim on the U.K. Treasury [website](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury). Likewise, there is no announcement on their [verified Twitter](https://twitter.com/hmtreasury?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) account.

In a recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Sunak reaffirmed the nation’s [support for Ukraine](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-call-with-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-25-october-2022). The U.K. sent £6 million to support Ukrainian [cyber defenses](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-boosts-ukraines-cyber-defences-with-6-million-support-package). Sunak reaffirmed his support for the war, stating that he would include another 1,000 surface-to-air missiles and 25,000 extreme cold winter kits, a [readout](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-call-with-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-10-november-2022) from a Nov. 10 call stated.**[(RELATED: Did German Satire Magazine Feature Caricature Of Zelenskyy?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2022/10/31/fact-check-germany-zelenskyy-ukraine-war/)**

Check Your Fact contacted Britain’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office for comment and will update this piece if a response is provided.

This is not the first time misinformation about Ukraine has spread online. Check Your Fact recently [debunked](https://checkyourfact.com/2022/11/03/fact-check-zelenskyy-book-hitler/) a claim Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s autobiography shares the same title as Hitler’s.
