**Fact Check:**¬†

 

The Azov Battalion is a Ukrainian ‚Äúfar-right all-volunteer infantry military unit whose members ‚Äì estimated at 900 ‚Äì are ultra-nationalists and accused of harbouring neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology,‚Äù according to [Al-Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/1/who-are-the-azov-regiment). Members of the battalion have been involved in some of the heaviest fighting throughout the war in Ukraine, [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraines-azov-battalion-looks-to-regroup-and-clean-up-image-11654453889) reported.

The Facebook post claims that Lego recently created official figurines of members of the battalion. Several images of the figurines, which carry rifles and wear fatigues, are included in the post.

‚ÄúLEGO created figures of steel heroes of Azovstal,‚Äù reads the post, which goes on to name specific Azov soldiers the company allegedly reproduced in Lego form.

‚ÄúYou can get most of the parts I used from @brickmaniatoys, although these particular figures are one-off creations that aren‚Äôt for sale,‚Äù said one [Twitter user](https://twitter.com/AndrewBecraft/status/1550302641313394689) who shared images of the figures.
