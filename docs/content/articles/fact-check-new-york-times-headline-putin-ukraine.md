An image [shared on X](https://twitter.com/TronBloke/status/1740685971018883252), formerly Twitter, purports to show a New York Times opinion piece headline about Russian President Vladimir Putin ‚Äúconquering Ukraine.‚Äù

**Verdict: False**

A New York Times spokesperson confirmed the headline was ‚Äúfabricated‚Äù in an email to Check Your Fact.

**Fact Check:**

 

During a recent visit to a military hospital in Moscow, Putin vowed to continue targeting Ukrainian ‚Äúmilitary installations,‚Äù according to [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-67858038). Putin‚Äôs comments follow a Saturday air raid by Ukraine on Belgorod, which killed 25 people, the outlet reported.

The X image purports to show a New York Times opinion piece headline about Putin ‚Äúconquering Ukraine.‚Äù The full headline reads as follows: ‚ÄúPutin May Have ‚ÄòConquered‚Äô Ukraine But All Its Women And Children Have Gone. Without The Financial Backing Of Prostitution And Child Porn Production, The Country Is Doomed, And Therefore His ‚ÄòVictory‚Äô Meaningless. And That‚Äôs A Good Thing. Here‚Äôs Why.‚Äù

According to the image, the purported headline appears to have been published on Dec. 27 by Serge Schmemann.

 

However, the image does not feature an authentic New York Times opinion piece headline. The purported headline neither appears on the [outlet‚Äôs website](https://www.nytimes.com/search?query=Putin+May+Have+%E2%80%98Conquered%E2%80%99+Ukraine+But+All+Its+Women+And+Children+Have+Gone.+Without+The+Financial+Backing+Of+Prostitution+And+Child+Porn+Production%2C+The+Country+Is+Doomed%2C+And+Therefore+His+%E2%80%98Victory%E2%80%99+Meaningless.+And+That%27s+A+Good+Thing.+Here%27s+Why) nor its verified [social](https://www.facebook.com/profile/100059174186752/search?q=Putin%20May%20Have%20%27Conquered%27%20Ukraine%20But%20All%20Its%20Women%20And%20Children%20Have%20Gone.%20Without%20The%20Financial%20Backing%20Of%20Prostitution%20And%20Child%20Porn%20Production%2C%20The%20Country%20Is%20Doomed%2C%20And%20Therefore%20His%20%27Victory%27%20Meaningless.%20And%20That%27s%20A%20Good%20Thing.%20Here%27s%20Why&filters=eyJycF9jcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lOjAiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJjcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lXCIsXCJhcmdzXCI6XCJ7XFxcInN0YXJ0X3llYXJcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIzXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIzLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfeWVhclxcXCI6XFxcIjIwMjNcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIzLTEyXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMy0xLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMy0xMi0zMVxcXCJ9XCJ9IiwicnBfY2hyb25vX3NvcnQ6MCI6IntcIm5hbWVcIjpcImNocm9ub3NvcnRcIixcImFyZ3NcIjpcIlwifSJ9) [media](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22Putin%20May%20Have%20%27Conquered%27%20Ukraine%20But%20All%20Its%20Women%20And%20Children%20Have%20Gone.%20Without%20The%20Financial%20Backing%20Of%20Prostitution%20And%20Child%20Porn%20Production%2C%20The%20Country%20Is%20Doomed%2C%20And%20Therefore%20His%20%27Victory%27%20Meaningless.%20And%20That%27s%20A%20Good%20Thing.%20Here%27s%20Why%22%20\(from%3Anytimes\)%20lang%3Aen&src=typed_query) [accounts](https://www.instagram.com/nytimes/?hl=en). A keyword search also does not generate [any genuine results](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=595080543&q=Putin+May+Have+%E2%80%98Conquered%E2%80%99+Ukraine+But+All+Its+Women+And+Children+Have+Gone.+Without+The+Financial+Backing+Of+Prostitution+And+Child+Porn+Production,+The+Country+Is+Doomed,+And+Therefore+His+%E2%80%98Victory%E2%80%99+Meaningless.+And+That%27s+A+Good+Thing.+Here%27s+Why+NYT&tbm=nws&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj86MvZ6b6DAxWUrYkEHaa3C3sQ0pQJegQIChAB&biw=1639&bih=877&dpr=2) for the headline. In fact, the only item appearing in the search results is an article from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/nyt-headline-ukraine-being-conquered-by-putin-is-fake-2023-12-29/), which also reported the claim as false.

Naseem Amini, a spokesperson for The New York Times, confirmed the headline was ‚Äúfabricated‚Äù in an email to Check Your Fact.

‚Äú\[I am\] confirming that headline is fabricated,‚Äù Amini said. Amini also directed Check Your Fact to the [actual headline](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/opinion/ukraine-military-aid.html) published by Schmemann on Dec. 27. ‚ÄúUkraine Doesn‚Äôt Need All Its Territory To Defeat Putin,‚Äù the opinion piece headline reads. **[(RELATED: Did The University of Edinburgh Put Out A Statement Apologizing To Palestinians?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/12/22/fact-check-university-edinburgh-apology-palestinians/)**

This is not the first time a false claim involving a major media outlet has circulated online. Check Your Fact previously [debunked](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/12/27/fact-check-video-cnn-ad-ukraine/) a Facebook video purporting to show a CNN advertisement mentioning Ukraine on a billboard in Times Square.
