A video [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UkrainevsRussiaGpunkt/videos/vb.100071128404439/875163070499426/?type=2&theater) claims Ukraine killed 12 high-ranking Russian generals in a single day with High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) strikes.  

**Verdict: Misleading**

 

Ukraine did not kill 12 generals in a single day, though they claimed the deaths of several Russian officers in December 2022.

**Fact Check:**

The United States has provided Ukraine with at least 20 HIMARS, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/world/europe/himars-rockets-us-ukraine-war.html). Ukrainian troops killed at least 63 Russian troops with a HIMARS strike on a Russian base earlier this month, the outlet reported.

 

The Facebook video, viewed more than 6,000 times, claims that 12 “high-ranking Russian generals” were “eliminated” in one day with HIMARS. The video’s caption reads, “Direct hit- 12 High-ranking Russian generals eliminated in a day with US Himars! Main base burning!”

There is no evidence that Ukraine eliminated 12 generals in a single day. If Ukraine had eliminated 12 generals in a single day with a HIMARS strike, media outlets would have covered it, yet [none have](https://www.google.com/search?q=12+russian+generals+killed&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjXqKvLoL38AhVmElkFHeCSBKIQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1440&bih=821&dpr=2). Check Your Fact reviewed updates and statements from the [Ukrainian Ministry of Defense](https://www.mil.gov.ua/en/news/) and the [General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua) and did not find any claiming to have killed 12 generals in a single day.

Ukraine has claimed to have killed several Russian generals over the duration of the war, according to [Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-russian-officer-elite-decimated-9-who-were-killed-in-combat-2022-3). Open-source information [compiled](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_bpIqkzD88hlSpA-PDZenSQGNnVnxz3lwYHKViSyuUc/edit) by the Twitter account [“KIU • Russian Officers killed in Ukraine”](https://twitter.com/KilledInUkraine) shows that 10 Russian generals have been killed in the conflict, though some of the deaths are disputed.

 

Some open-source intelligence (OSINT) accounts did report that Ukrainian forces used HIMARS to hit a Russian command post in the Kherson region in December 2022. DefMon3 [claimed](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1608928875807125504) that officers of the 36th Combined Arms Army (CAA) were killed in the strike.  **[(RELATED: Did The Ukrainians Hit The Crimea Bridge With A HIMARS Missile?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2022/10/21/fact-check-ukrainians-bridge-missile/)**

“The AFU hit an army level command post in Kheson region. RU Officers from the 36th CAA, units: 37th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, 75th Control Brigade, 26th NBC Protection Regiment And from 68th AC: 39th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade,” the account tweeted.

Misinformation surrounding the status of the war has circulated on social media since its start in February 2022. Check Your Fact recently [debunked](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/01/10/fact-check-russia-collapse-seconds/) a claim that suggested Russia had collapsed in a matter of “seconds” after a military breakthrough by Ukraine.
