DISINFO: Europe is preparing for war with Russia and Poland is claiming Ukrainian territory
===========================================================================================

### SUMMARY

Europe is preparing for war with Russia and is looking at the territory of Ukraine. Ukraine's neighbors are preparing to divide its territories. Poland said it should have a decisive voice when it comes to the future of Ukraine. Such speeches make Ukraine very nervous, because there has already been information that Warsaw is eyeing the western Ukrainian territories.

### RESPONSE

This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative accusing the West of warmongering, direct involvement in [Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?text=russia%20ukraine%20invasion&date=&per_page=) and attempting to distract attention from the crimes Russian forces committed during the invasion. See our article [All roads lead to Poland.](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/all-roads-lead-to-poland/)

None of the states neighboring Ukraine, except Russia, has any territorial claims to Ukraine. [Poland](https://www.wnp.pl/parlamentarny/wydarzenia/zaryn-o-ataku-putina-na-polske-powtarzanie-zupelnie-oderwanych-od-rzeczywistosci-insynuacji,641414.html) has [repeatedly](https://twitter.com/PolandMFA/status/1490617501897662464) and categorically denied statements by the Russian leadership about the intentions of these countries to “occupy Ukrainian territories.”

Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, during a [speech in the Polish Sejm](https://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-debata-po-expose-szefa-polskiej-dyplomacji-zapis,nId,7473039#crp_state=1) on April 25, 2024, once again refuted the Russian narrative. Sikorski stressed that the true direction of Poland’s foreign policy is to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression. The politician recalled that Poland, in order to increase the effectiveness of its actions, joined the declaration of the G7 countries on security guarantees for Ukraine. Maintaining the EU's full support for Ukraine's independence, including its efforts towards EU membership, will be a priority of the government's European policy, Sikorsky emphasized.

“_Russia is lying about Poland's alleged plans to annex parts of Ukraine. Donbas is Ukraine; Crimea is Ukraine. Lviv, Volyn, former Eastern Galicia are also Ukraine. Therefore, I repeat so that the Kremlin can hear: Lviv is Ukrainian_,” [Sikorsky said](https://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-debata-po-expose-szefa-polskiej-dyplomacji-zapis,nId,7473039#crp_state=1).
