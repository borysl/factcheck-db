A video [shared on X](https://twitter.com/Sprinter99800/status/1704885947710476602), the platform formerly known as Twitter, claims to show a “Glory to Urine” billboard in Times Square, New York.

 

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that this billboard exists.

**Fact Check:**

 

Social media users have been sharing a video claiming that a billboard in New York City shows “Glory to Urine” instead of “Glory to Ukraine,” a common Ukrainian slogan. The video, which shows a Fox News Digital logo, was shared widely on X.

There is no evidence, though, that this occurred. Check Your Fact did not find any [credible news outlets](https://www.google.com/search?q=glory+to+urine&sca_esv=567639170&tbm=nws&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi65OHK6b6BAxWbF2IAHVhfAQcQ_AUoBHoECAIQBg&biw=1440&bih=815&dpr=2) reporting on the alleged billboard. Instead, multiple outlets, including fact-checking website [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/news/2023/09/21/glory-to-urine-billboard/), reported that the billboard was a viral fake.

A Fox News spokesperson told Check Your Fact in an email that “FOX News Digital did not publish this video.” **[(RELATED: Posts Claims Ukrainian Challenger 2 Tank Was Not Destroyed)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/09/11/fact-check-ukrainian-challenger-tank-destroyed/)**

 

Markian Kuzmowycz, who works in digital analysis for Microsoft, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/markiank/status/1704917863855714786) out a picture of where the alleged billboard was located and pointed out issues with the original X video.

“RU info ops doing the fake ad in Times Sq. thing, yet again, claiming a pro-UKR ad today reads ‘Glory to Urine’, shared by top RU war correspondent WarGonzo. I snapped a photo of that intersection of 42nd/8th, where there’s no scaffolding. Video manipulated, not remotely recent,” Kuzmowycz tweeted. 

Check Your Fact could not find the original footage. This article will be updated if an original source is found.
