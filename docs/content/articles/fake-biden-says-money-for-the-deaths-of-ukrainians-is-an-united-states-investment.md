**The US President spoke of investing in the democratic world’s security and stability, not “investing in the deaths of Ukrainians.”**

Pro-Kremlin media outlets are [spreading](https://web.archive.org/web/20231024184122/https:/www.kp.ru/daily/27571.5/4839895/) manipulative news based on the US President’s address, which refers to the US response to Hamas’ terrorist attacks against Israel and Russia’s war against Ukraine. [Misrepresenting the content of Joe Biden’s speech](https://web.archive.org/web/20231024184230/https:/eadaily.com/ru/news/2023/10/20/ssha-priznali-chto-obmanyvali-mir-prikryvayas-borboy-za-demokratiyu-zaharova), Russian media stated that the American President allegedly “admitted that he deceived the world under the guise of fighting for democracy” and called assistance to Ukraine “an investment in murder and the American military-industrial complex.”

“_Investments in the military conflicts in Israel and Ukraine are necessary for the well-being of the American economy and its military-industrial complex_,” [Russian media write](https://web.archive.org/web/20231024184446/https:/www.kp.ru/daily/27571.5/4839950/).

“_In Washington, talks of the fight for democracy and ‘smart investments’ cover their financial calculation… Washington does not care about Israelis and Palestinians, or Ukrainians. It makes no difference to them where the war will be fought. If it were possible to start fighting on Mars, the United States would intervene there as well_,” [Russian media summarize](https://vz.ru/news/2023/10/20/1235933.html).

On October 19, the US President delivered a special [address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKd8pcZC0G0&ab_channel=%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%90%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8) in which he emphasized the need for further support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression and the US solidarity with Israel. The US President did indeed call assistance to Ukraine and Israel, which were attacked by terrorists, an investment for US citizens. However, the Russian media took Joe Biden’s quote out of context, successfully “forgetting” to explain why the head of the White House used this particular expression.

Biden was not referring to investments in “killing Ukrainians” or the American military-industrial complex, as the Russian media wrote. The president was talking about investing in the security and stability of the democratic world. Biden noted that when terrorists do not pay the price for their terror, and dictators do not pay for their aggression, they cause even more chaos, death and destruction, triggering a chain of unpunished cruelty around the world.

The American President emphasized that there is a direct link between Ukraine’s victory in the Russian war and the well-being of American citizens. Biden emphasized that if we do not stop dictator Putin and his ilk now, after Ukraine and Israel, they will move on to other countries – the NATO countries, including the United States.

“**_So, if we don’t stop Putin’s appetite for power_** _and control in Ukraine,_ **_he won’t limit himself just to Ukraine_**_.  He’s — Putin has already threated to “remind” — quote, “remind” Poland that their western land was a gift from Russia. One of his top advisors, a former president of Russia, has called Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania Russia’s “Baltic provinces.”  These are all NATO Allies. For 75 years, NATO has kept peace in Europe and has been the cornerstone of American security.  And if_ **_Putin attacks a NATO Ally_**_, we will defend every inch of NATO which the treaty requires and calls for. We will have something that we do not seek — make it clear: we do not seek —_ **_we do not seek to have American troops fighting in Russia or fighting against Russia_**,” Biden [emphasized](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/20/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-unites-states-response-to-hamass-terrorist-attacks-against-israel-and-russias-ongoing-brutal-war-against-ukraine/).

It is in this context of the possible spread of Putin’s aggression to NATO countries and the prevention of direct clashes between the United States and Russia that Joe Biden said that on October 20 he was sending an urgent request to Congress to fund America’s national security needs “to support our critical partners Israel and Ukraine.”

“_It’s a smart investment that’s going to pay dividends for American security for generations,_ **_help us keep American troops out of harm’s way_**_, help us build a world that is safer, more peaceful, and more prosperous for our children and grandchildren_,” Biden [emphasized](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/20/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-unites-states-response-to-hamass-terrorist-attacks-against-israel-and-russias-ongoing-brutal-war-against-ukraine/). 

In addition, the American President noted the successes of the Ukrainian army. Biden emphasized that “Kyiv still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people,” and Ukraine has already regained more than 50% of the territory occupied by Russian troops. In this regard, the US President reiterated the need to support Ukraine, as democracy “cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win,” Biden [summarized](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/20/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-unites-states-response-to-hamass-terrorist-attacks-against-israel-and-russias-ongoing-brutal-war-against-ukraine/).
