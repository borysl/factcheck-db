A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/chantal.dealcyone/posts/pfbid0UAd7TJaBsbfmwKrkJ6RpHkqK4avhLb2tAjUFqpWDowf2JHrpKWqM5rqjVeUMSGSXl) purports Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly had Mikhail Abramovich, a physician working on a vaccine for White Lung Pneumonia, executed.

 

**Verdict: False**

The claim is false and stems from a Dec. 1 article published by the satire site, “Real Raw News.”

**Fact Check:**

 

Putin recently met with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/putin-makes-rare-trip-to-middle-east-to-meet-with-uae-and-saudi-leaders). The purpose of Putin’s visit was to “raise Moscow’s profile as a Middle East power broker,” [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-cop28-uae-vladimir-putin-saudi-arabia-e0366e26d7b7588a28f4b6868ecdca0e) reported.

The Facebook post purports Putin allegedly had the “White Lung” doctor executed. The post does not provide a source to support the claim.

The claim is false and stems from a [Dec. 1 article](https://realrawnews.com/2023/12/putin-executes-white-lung-doctor/) published by the satire site, “Real Raw News.” The article claims Putin had Abramovich, a physician working on a vaccine for White Lung Pneumonia, executed. In addition, the article claims Abramovich “implored pharmaceutical giants” to use the COVID-19 vaccine as the template for the White Lung Pneumonia vaccine and said all pre-pubescent Russian children should receive the vaccination.
