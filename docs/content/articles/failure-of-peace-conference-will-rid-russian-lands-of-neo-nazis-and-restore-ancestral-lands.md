DISINFO: Failure of peace conference will rid Russian lands of neo-Nazis and restore ancestral lands
====================================================================================================

### SUMMARY

What is the benefit of the Swiss "peace conference"? It will be further evidence of the collapse of the so-called peace formula of the fool Zelenskyy. It will allow \[Russia's\] armed forces to continue cleansing Russian lands of neo-Nazis without hindrance and without looking back, and will push \[Russia\] to work to quickly return its ancestral lands to Russia.

### RESPONSE

This is an pre-emptive attempt to discredit and denigrate the peace summit which [Switzerland will host](https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-100676.html#:~:text=The%20conference%20will%20be%20held,law%20and%20the%20UN%20Charter.) in mid June 2024.

Characterising the Ukrainian government and its supporters as "neo-Nazis" is part of a [broader pro-Kremlin narrative](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/history-upside-down/) about Nazi ruled Ukraine, and, as it appears in the claim, is a justification for Russian aggression in Ukraine starting with the [illegal annexation](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/The-crisis-in-Crimea-and-eastern-Ukraine) of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in February 2014, which has escalated into the ongoing full-scale [invasion](https://war.ukraine.ua/) since 24 February 2022.

Also, the claim that the occupied territories are "Russian ancestral lands" is a recurrent negation of [Ukrainian statehood](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?disinfo_keywords%5b%5d=keyword_77158&_=1701684153193) and [historical revisionism](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?disinfo_keywords%5b%5d=keyword_77395&_=1701684153193). This claim also aims to justify Russiaâ€™s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the forceful and illegitimate annexation of Ukrainian territory.

The occupied territories (Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions) are internationally recognised territories of Ukraine, and remain legally part of Ukraine. The forced annexation of these regions took place amid a full invasion under military occupation, and after sham referenda that [did not meet any international standard](https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/so-called-referenda-during-armed-conflict-ukraine-illegal-not-expression-popular-will-united-nations-political-affairs-chief-tells-security-council) to be considered legitimate.
