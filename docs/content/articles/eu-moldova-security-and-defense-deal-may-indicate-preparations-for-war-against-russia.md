DISINFO: EU - Moldova security and defense deal may indicate preparations for war against Russia
================================================================================================

### SUMMARY

The agreement between the European Union and Moldova in the field of security and defense may indicate that the EU is preparing the country for a war with Russia on the Dniester.

Taking into account the fact that the European Union is de facto in a state of undeclared war with Russia, there is no doubt that Moldova is being prepared for a possible war against Russia on the Dniester.

### RESPONSE

Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that the EU is waging a p[roxy war](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?text=proxy%20war) against Russia, and that Moldova is being instigated by the West to prepare for a war against Russia.

The claim refers to the [Security and Defense Partnership](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/g12nbsvs/security-and-defence-partnership_eu-md_for-website-publication.pdf) [signed on 21 May](https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-257187) in Brussels by Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean and Joseph Borell, the European Commission Vice-President.

Moldova is the first country to sign a Security and Defence Partnership with the EU:

"The European Union and the Republic of Moldova face an increasingly challenging security environment inter alia due to ongoing Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. The EU and Moldova are committed to strengthening rules-based international order and upholding the respect for the United Nations (UN) Charter”, is written in the first chapter of the document.

The agreement provides for collaboration and exchange of information, expertise in the fields of cyber security, hybrid threats, combating extremism. The [Partnership](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/moldova/security-and-defence-partnership_en?s=223) does not contain any provision about arming or other military actions.
