**Verdict: False**

The post is miscaptioned. The video depicts a Russian attack on Ukraine from March.

**Fact Check:**¬†

 

Palestine has accused Israel of using white phosphorus bombs during the conflict that‚Äôs now estimated to have claimed at least 2,100 lives on both sides, according to Pakistani news outlet [Dunya News](https://dunyanews.tv/en/World/761875-Israel-raining-banned-phosphorous-bombs-on-Gaza-as-death-toll-climbs-to-). The use of these weapons in civilian areas is considered a war crime and is condemned by the 1980 UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, according to the [Palestine Chronicle](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/palestinian-fm-raises-alarm-israel-is-using-white-phosphorus-in-gaza/).

An X video appears to show white, glowing lights falling from the sky while smoke can be seen in the background. ‚ÄúLATEST: Shocking! Israel air force drops white Phosphorus bombs on Gaza,‚Äù the post reads.

The footage has been miscaptioned. The video was posted to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZISFFQLoPMY&ab_channel=TheTelegraph) in March 2023. ‚ÄúRussian forces appeared to target the eastern town of Vuhledar with incendiary thermite munitions,‚Äù the description reads. ‚ÄúVideos taken of the alleged attack show brightly burning metals raining from the sky on the coal-mining town, while a Ukrainian can be heard talking in the background.‚Äù **[(RELATED: Video Of Missile Strike Is From 2020, Not From A Recent Hamas Attack)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/10/11/fact-check-video-of-missile-strike-is-from-2020-not-from-a-recent-hamas-attack/)**

 

News outlets such as [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21682538/ukraine-flesh-melting-thermite-russia-deadliest/) and [Daily Star](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/putin-using-deadly-thermite-bombs-29461083) used the same video in news reports on the thermite rain. Thermite bombs are made by mixing metal powder with metal oxide and are capable of burning through human flesh, according to [The Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-turns-cruelest-weapon-arsenal-29437157).
