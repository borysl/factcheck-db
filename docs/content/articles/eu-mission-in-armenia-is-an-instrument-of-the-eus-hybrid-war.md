DISINFO: EU mission in Armenia is an instrument of the EU's hybrid war
======================================================================

### SUMMARY

The EU observation mission in Armenia has actually turned into a paramilitary Western operation of NATO member states with dubious goals. The staff has already been at least doubled, and new strongholds are opening. Most recently, an agreement on the status of the EU mission was imposed on Yerevan, granting it most favoured nation treatment and freedom of action on Armenian territory.

The mission's secrecy, lack of accountability, and lack of control by either Armenia, Azerbaijan, or other interested countries and structures confirm the fact that the mission is an instrument of the EU’s hybrid war. The mission conducts openly provocative activities and is fully engaged in anti-Russian propaganda, instilling false ideas in Armenian society about the European Union as a “source of security and prosperity” for Armenia. Moreover, the activities of the EU are becoming increasingly anti-Azerbaijani and anti-Iranian in nature.

### RESPONSE

Intensively repeated disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets attempting to discredit the [EU mission in Armenia](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?disinfo_countries[]=country_77600&text=EU%20mission), accusing it of [espionage](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/eu-mission-is-spying-on-russia-iran-and-azerbaijan-from-the-territory-of-armenia/), [anti-Russian](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-purpose-of-eu-monitors-in-armenia-is-to-spy-on-russian-troops), [anti-Iranian](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/eu-observers-are-deployed-in-armenia-to-monitor-iran-and-if-necessary-launch-a-military-operations-against-it/) and [anti-Azerbaijani](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/eu-mission-in-armenia-contributes-to-the-spread-of-azerbaijanophobia/) activities.

The [EU Mission](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/euma_en?s=410283) in Armenia (EUMA) [is a civilian mission](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/429390_hy?s=410283) that observes and reports on the security situation on the ground, contributes to the security of the people in conflict-affected areas in Armenia, and builds confidence on the ground. Through its presence, EUMA also contributes to ensuring an environment conducive to the normalisation efforts between Armenia and Azerbaijan supported by the EU.

From the very beginning, this [exclusively civilian mission](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/429390_hy?s=410283) has been fully transparent about its plans to [operate from six hubs](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1122175/). It has no links to NATO or troops from its member countries. From the moment of its launch, EUMA was a target for disinformation, as discussed in our analysis [The wrong the wicked and the wacky. Claims about the EU mission in Armenia](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/the-wrong-the-wicked-and-the-wacky-claims-about-the-eu-mission-in-armenia).

The mission was [launched in Armenia](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/euma/about-european-union-mission-armenia_en) in response to a request by Armenia. [EUMA conducts routine patrolling and reports on the situation,](https://euneighbourseast.eu/news/latest-news/armenia-eu-establishes-civilian-mission-to-contribute-to-stability-in-border-areas/) which strengthens the EU’s understanding of the situation on the ground.

The decision to deploy the EU monitors on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan was made after the [September 2022 escalation](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220913IPR40314/meps-call-armenia-and-azerbaijan-to-respect-the-ceasefire-agreement).
