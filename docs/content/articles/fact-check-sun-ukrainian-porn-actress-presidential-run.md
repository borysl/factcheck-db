A video [shared on X](https://twitter.com/Ramy_Sawma/status/1726734576242819292), formerly Twitter, allegedly shows a report from The Sun about a Ukrainian porn star who announced that she intends to run for president of her country.

**Verdict: False**

The video is digitally altered. There is no evidence that The Sun published this video or that the porn star made this statement.

**Fact Check:**¬†

 

A 45-year-old Russian general was killed after being blown up by a landmine in Ukraine, according to [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67579357). The mine is speculated to have been placed by a fellow Russian unit to target Ukrainians, [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-general-vladimir-zavadsky-blown-up-on-a-mine-in-ukraine) reported.

An X post purports a Ukrainian adult film actress plans to run for president of the country. The video shared in the post allegedly shows the actress speaking about war before revealing her aspiration to run for president.

‚ÄúThe most popular Ukrainian porn actress Nancy A wants to become president,‚Äù the video‚Äôs text reads.

 

She also appears to say that Ukrainian men who hide from war or don‚Äôt donate to the Ukrainian army are ‚Äúslugs,‚Äù and that she and other Ukrainian porn models are doing more for their country. A logo for The Sun can be seen in the top right corner of the video.

The claim is baseless, however. The alleged story cannot be found on any of The Sun‚Äôs [social](https://twitter.com/search?q=porn%20actress%20president%20\(from%3ATheSun\)&src=typed_query) [media](https://www.instagram.com/thesun/?hl=en) [accounts](https://www.facebook.com/profile/100064352752846/search/?q=porn%20actress%20president).¬†There are no [credible news reports](https://www.google.com/search?q=ukrainian+porn+actress+wants+to+become+president&sca_esv=586679140&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1076US1076&tbm=nws&sxsrf=AM9HkKndaRx95Rtwk7rl-8yHxcpJFhMoWA:1701370520638&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi64Y2Ms-yCAxXok2oFHfXPDpIQ_AUoAnoECAIQBA&biw=1920&bih=923&dpr=1) from The Sun or other outlets to corroborate the claim. **[(RELATED: Claim Of Special Forces Arresting Ukrainians In The US Originates As Satire)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/11/21/fact-check-special-forces-arresting-ukrainians-us/)**

The unedited footage was originally posted to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYodd9YUUF4)¬†in 2020, and no presidential run is mentioned.
