An image [shared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/IndividualRSA/status/1657116603333464065) purports to show a screenshot of a Moscow Times article claiming Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly collapsed after suffering a heart attack.

**Verdict: False**

The screenshot appears to be digitally fabricated, as the headline neither appears on the outlet‚Äôs website nor its social media accounts. A reverse image search reveals the photos were created using artificial intelligence (AI).

**Fact Check:**

 

Putin said a ‚Äúreal war‚Äù is being waged on Russia during his May 9 Victory Day speech, according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-real-war-is-being-waged-against-russia-victory-day-speech-2023-05-09/). Putin‚Äôs comments followed a barrage of missiles Moscow unleashed on targets in Ukraine, [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-parade-victory-day-3bc68ae74f7343d679bbb05ab3aec98d) reported.

‚ÄúPresident Putin suffers heart attack,‚Äù the headline of the Moscow Times article shared on Twitter purports. The post has received nearly 22,000 views at the time of publication.

The claim is false. The screenshot appears to be digitally fabricated, as the headline neither appears on the [outlet‚Äôs website](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/search) nor its [social](https://www.facebook.com/profile/100064737128656/search?q=President%20Putin%20suffers%20heart%20attack.&filters=eyJycF9jcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lOjAiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJjcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lXCIsXCJhcmdzXCI6XCJ7XFxcInN0YXJ0X3llYXJcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIzXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIzLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfeWVhclxcXCI6XFxcIjIwMjNcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIzLTEyXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMy0xLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMy0xMi0zMVxcXCJ9XCJ9IiwicnBfY2hyb25vX3NvcnQ6MCI6IntcIm5hbWVcIjpcImNocm9ub3NvcnRcIixcImFyZ3NcIjpcIlwifSJ9) [media](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22president%20putin%20suffers%20heart%20attack.%22%20\(from%3AMoscowTimes\)%20lang%3Aen&src=typed_query) [accounts](https://www.instagram.com/themoscowtimes/). A reverse image search reveals the photos of Putin included in the screenshot were [originally posted to Twitter](https://twitter.com/mishapetrof/status/1638560783062663169) in March 2022. A [translation](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+translate&oq=&aqs=chrome.2.69i60j46i131i199i433i465i512j69i59j0i131i433i512j69i60l2j69i65j69i60.3832j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of the post‚Äôs caption alleges that Putin fell during a meeting in the Kremlin.

 

A [subsequent tweet](https://twitter.com/mishapetrof/status/1638560783062663169) posted by the social media user who shared the photo indicated the photos were created using AI. In a [third tweet](https://twitter.com/mishapetrof/status/1638863092703539201), the user named Midjourney as the AI program used to create the images.

Likewise, there have been [no credible news reports](https://www.google.com/search?q=president+vladimir+putin+collapses+after+having+a+heart+attack+may+2023&ei=O11iZI2VDNCo5NoP89mw4A4&ved=0ahUKEwjNnuLY3vf-AhVQFFkFHfMsDOwQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=president+vladimir+putin+collapses+after+having+a+heart+attack+may+2023&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQA0oECEEYAVCjA1jlDWDzEWgBcAB4AIABVYgBjgSSAQE3mAEAoAEBwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) supporting the claim Putin collapsed after suffering a heart attack. Had the Russian President actually experienced a heart attack, the media would have covered it. In addition, the Kremlin has not publicly addressed the claim on its [website](http://kremlin.ru/search?query=president+vladimir+putin+suffered+a+heart+attack+may+2023) or [verified Twitter account](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22president%20vladimir%20putin%20suffered%20a%20heart%20attack%20may%202023%22%20\(from%3AKremlinRussia_E\)%20lang%3Aen&src=typed_query). **[(RELATED: Did Vladimir Putin Blame Americans For Interfering With Their Own Democracy?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/04/20/fact-check-vladimir-putin-america-democracy/)**
