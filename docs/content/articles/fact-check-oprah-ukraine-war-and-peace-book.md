A post [shared on Facebook](https://archive.ph/cRTnL) claims Oprah Winfrey announced the removal of the book “War and Peace” from her book club in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

 

**Verdict: False**

The person who originally made the claim later said it was satirical. There is no evidence Winfrey announced the book’s removal.

**Fact Check:**

 

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now in its seventh week and has resulted in the deaths of more than 1,800 civilians, according to a U.N. [report](https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2022/04/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-11-april-2022). Russia has faced massive sanctions and boycotts for its role in the bloodshed with companies like Apple and Nike pausing sales in the country, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/sanctions-boycotts-west-response-russian-invasion-ukraine) reported.

The Facebook post claims that in response to the invasion, Winfrey announced the removal of Russian author Leo Tolstoy’s famed book “[War and Peace](https://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/B08DSX931G/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=3PNRKT6AU2V1Y&keywords=War+and+peace&qid=1649776255&sprefix=war+and+peac%2Caps%2C274&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWjJSWjhNRkxZUjBVJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjg4MzMyMVBUQzdOVUZEMzRTUyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTYwNTIwMlpVSkxBUVQ4QUpXVSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=)” from her book club. The book, which was published between 1865 and 1869, is a historical novel that centers on Napoleon Bonaparte’s 1812 invasion of Russia, according to [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/War-and-Peace).

There is no evidence Winfrey has made an announcement regarding the removal of the book. Check Your Fact reviewed [her website](https://www.oprah.com/search.html?q=war+and+peace) but did not find the book [listed](https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/books/g23067476/oprah-book-club-list/) as one of the 93 works selected by her book club. Likewise, no statement about its removal appear on the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=War%20And%20Peace%20\(from%3AOprah%20AND%20OWNTV\)&src=typed_query&f=top) accounts, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile/100044572113214/search/?q=War%20and%20Peace) [pages](https://www.facebook.com/page/119068338119500/search/?q=War%20and%20Peace) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oprah/?hl=en) [profiles](https://www.instagram.com/owntv/?hl=en) of Winfrey or OWN TV, Winfrey’s TV network.

 

None of the major publishers that sell “War and Peace,” such as [Penguin Random House](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/about-us/news) and [Simon & Schuster](https://about.simonandschuster.biz/), have issued statements regarding any removal of the book from any book clubs. **[(RELATED:](https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/12/fact-check-meghan-markle-george-soros-son/) [Does This Picture Show Meghan Markle With George Soros’ Son?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/12/fact-check-meghan-markle-george-soros-son/)**

There are also at least 200 mentions of “War and Peace” on Oprah’s website. Articles such as “[Finding Inspiration in Tolstoy’s _War and Peace_](https://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/tolstoys-war-and-peace)” and “[How to Read _War and Peace_](https://www.oprah.com/omagazine/how-to-read-war-and-peace_1),” are still available to read and have not been removed. Notably, Tolstoy’s book “[Anna Karenina](https://www.amazon.com/Anna-Karenina-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/B08MVPXVG8/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=348SLC1HD9RR&keywords=Anna+Karenina&qid=1649776953&sprefix=anna+karenina%2Caps%2C156&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExS1QxQlQ4WlE0VzdMJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTQ5NTMyMUg2RlRJTTVIUEE2WSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTMwODk4MzFaMUpFSEQwQTdHOSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=)” was selected by the book club in 2004 and remains listed on [Oprah.com](https://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/complete-list-of-oprahs-book-club-books/all).

The claim appears to stem from opinion column writer Maitreya Bhakal, who tweeted [Feb. 26](https://twitter.com/MaitreyaBhakal/status/1497674662742228992) that Winfrey had removed the book. The original tweet has been retweeted over 3,000 times. Bhakal later [tweeted](https://twitter.com/MaitreyaBhakal/status/1497973997962948609) that his original tweet was “satire”.
