A video [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2437137719828071&id=100005956005728) purports to show a CNN advertisement mentioning Ukraine on a billboard in Times Square.

 

**Verdict: False**

The video is not authentic. A CNN spokesperson denied the video’s authenticity in an email to Reuters.

**Fact Check:**

 

The Ukrainian Air Force said it has destroyed the Russian warship Novocherkassk in Feodosia, a port in Crimea, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/26/world/europe/ukraine-crimea-russia-warship-novocherkassk.html). The Novocherkassk is a large ship that can transport soldiers, tanks, and armored vehicles, [Al-Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/ukraine-claims-to-have-destroyed-russian-ship-in-crimea-attack) reported.

The Facebook video purports to show a CNN advertisement mentioning Ukraine on a billboard in Times Square. “Kyiv is all over. Will the Russians stop there or go further? Discover this and more on Political Briefing,” the text of the alleged advertisement reads. The video’s caption claims “few people believe Ukraine will win” its ongoing war with Russia.

The video is not authentic, however. CNN spokesperson Emily Kuhn denied the video’s authenticity in an email to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/times-square-kyiv-is-all-over-ad-is-not-real-cnn-billboard-2023-12-22/).

 

“This is a doctored video and is not an ad that ran on behalf of CNN,” Kuhn said.

In addition, the video is neither referenced on [CNN’s website](https://www.cnn.com/search?q=A+CNN+advertisement+in+New+York+shows+that+even+in+the+United+States%2C+few+people+believe+Ukraine+will+win.&from=0&size=10&page=1&sort=newest&types=all&section=) nor on its verified [social](https://www.facebook.com/profile/100059479812265/search?q=A%20CNN%20advertisement%20in%20New%20York%20shows%20that%20even%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C%20few%20people%20believe%20Ukraine%20will%20win.&filters=eyJycF9jcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lOjAiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJjcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lXCIsXCJhcmdzXCI6XCJ7XFxcInN0YXJ0X3llYXJcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIzXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIzLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfeWVhclxcXCI6XFxcIjIwMjNcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIzLTEyXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMy0xLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMy0xMi0zMVxcXCJ9XCJ9IiwicnBfY2hyb25vX3NvcnQ6MCI6IntcIm5hbWVcIjpcImNocm9ub3NvcnRcIixcImFyZ3NcIjpcIlwifSJ9) [media](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22A%20CNN%20advertisement%20in%20New%20York%20shows%20that%20even%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C%20few%20people%20believe%20Ukraine%20will%20win.%22%20\(from%3ACNN\)%20lang%3Aen&src=typed_query) [accounts](https://www.instagram.com/cnn/). Likewise, Check Your Fact did not find [any credible news reports](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=593987521&q=A+CNN+advertisement+in+New+York+shows+that+even+in+the+United+States,+few+people+believe+Ukraine+will+win.&tbm=nws&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjR7YfB4K-DAxW4m4kEHXIgC4wQ0pQJegQIChAB&biw=1639&bih=877&dpr=2) to support the claim.

Furthermore, a keyword search [reveals](https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/political-briefing) that “Political Briefing” is a podcast hosted by CNN’s Political Director, David Chalian. Chalian [has not publicly commented](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22A%20CNN%20advertisement%20in%20New%20York%20shows%20that%20even%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C%20few%20people%20believe%20Ukraine%20will%20win.%22%20\(from%3ADavidChalian\)%20lang%3Aen&src=typed_query) on the claim involving the Facebook video. **[(RELATED: Video Claims To Show Egyptian Smuggling Food Through Gaza Border Wall)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/12/27/fact-check-video-claims-to-show-egyptian-boy-smuggling-food-through-gaza-border-wall/)**

According to Reuters, the billboard that appears in the Facebook video is on the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square and is nicknamed the “Big Kahuna.” A map available via Google places the [billboard’s location](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7579921,-73.9855134,3a,75y,328.62h,112.24t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sIkaZbYTQP9tOxQMT-vI66A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) at 7th Avenue. The billboard is [owned](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/08/17/2500093/0/en/SILVERCAST-Brings-CITY-3D-Media-Art-to-Times-Square.html) by Silvercast Media.

Silvercast Media spokesperson Gary Grossman also denied the video’s authenticity, labeling it as “fake,” according to Reuters.
