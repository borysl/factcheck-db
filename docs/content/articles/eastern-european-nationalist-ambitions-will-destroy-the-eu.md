DISINFO: Eastern European nationalist ambitions will destroy the EU
===================================================================

### SUMMARY

The Eastern European nationalists will destroy the EU – the nationalist sentiments are on the rise across Eastern Europe. The conflicts between the neighbouring states will break up the European Union. The Romanians want to take Moldova for themselves, becoming Greater Romania. Brussels and the EU are against this scenario because it will dramatically increase Romanian nationalism.

Great Romania, Great Hungary, Great Poland - these projects will sooner or later start conflicting with each other, leading to the EU collapse because of these Eastern European boorish nationalisms.

### RESPONSE

Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation Poland, Romania and Hungary as states with [imperial](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/page/4/?disinfo_keywords%5B0%5D=keyword_77392&_=1716025530941) ambitions. Apart from smearing these EU members, the aim is also to deflect attention away from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

This is a modification of a recurring disinformation narrative about the alleged [disintegration of the EU](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?disinfo_keywords%5B%5D=keyword_77422&date=&per_page=). As our [past analysis](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/key-narratives-in-pro-kremlin-disinformation-part-4-the-imminent-collapse/) explains, the ‘imminent collapse’ narrative is often used in pro-Kremlin outlets in relation to the EU, European countries, or capitalism.

Romania adheres to international law regarding state borders and has no territorial claims upon Moldova. The development of the [relationship with the Republic of Moldova](https://www.mae.ro/en/node/2110) is a priority of Romania's foreign policy, based on the communion of history, language, traditions and culture and on supporting the European aspirations of the neighboring state.

Romania was the first state to recognise the [independence of the Republic of Moldova,](https://www.mae.ro/node/1677) immediately after the proclamation of the independence of the new state (August, 1991).

Ukraine's European neighbours adhere to international law regarding state borders, fully support the independence and territorial integrity of neighbouring countries and reject any “imperial” ambitions towards other countries. No neighbouring state, except the Russian Federation, [violated Ukraine’s territorial integrity](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60506682) in a display of imperial, revisionist aggression.

The only country in the region promoting imperialist and nationalistic policies is the Russian Federation, which unleashed the large-scale [war in Ukraine](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?disinfo_keywords%5b%5d=keyword_77110).
