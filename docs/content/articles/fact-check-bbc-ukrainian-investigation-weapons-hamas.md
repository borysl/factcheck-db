**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that BBC News published this video.

**Fact Check:**

 

Social media users have been sharing claims that BBC News and Bellingcat reported that Ukrainian official David Arakhamia was linked to the sale of weapons to Hamas. Another version, since deleted, claimed to show a video of the report. **[(RELATED: Does Image Show An Israeli Soldier Standing On A Palestinian Child?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/12/05/fact-check-israeli-soldier-standing-palestinian-child/)**

“They say the \*ICC is already preparing a case against Arakhamia. This insider came to journalists from the BBC and Bellingcat. He is linked to the sale of Western weapons to Hamas representatives, which led to a successful attack on Israel in October,” the post partially reads.

This claim is false. Check Your Fact reviewed Bellingcat’s [website](https://www.bellingcat.com/) for any reporting matching the tweet. This search did not yield any results. A search of the BBC’s website also did not yield [any results](https://www.bbc.com/) for the alleged video.

 

Bellingcat debunked the [claim](https://twitter.com/bellingcat/status/1732389779902193888) in a Dec. 6 tweet.

  
“This is not a BBC News video,” a BBC spokesperson told CheckYour Fact in an email. The spokesperson also pointed out that BBC Verify Shayan Sardarizadeh retweeted a post from Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins [debunking](https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins/status/1732396275700518949) the claim.

Sardarizadeh also [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Shayan86/status/1732465513043828992) out a debunk of the claim.

“Yet another fake video attributed to BBC News and Bellingcat has appeared on Russian Telegram, falsely suggesting Ukraine is selling arms to Hamas, some of which was used in the 7 October attack. The video features fake quotes by [@EliotHiggins](https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and me. It’s total nonsense,” Sardarizadeh tweeted.

Check Your Fact previously [debunked](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/12/01/fact-check-bbc-news-bellingcat-ukrainian-official/) other posts claiming to show BBC and Bellingcat reports.
