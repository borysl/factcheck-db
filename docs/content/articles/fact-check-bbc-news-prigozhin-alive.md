A video [shared on X](https://twitter.com/AlertChannel/status/1696623683316359351), the platform formerly known as Twitter, claims to show a BBC News report stating Wagner Group founder Yevengy Prigozhin is still alive.

 

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that the BBC created this video. A spokesperson for the organization said the video was fake.

**Fact Check:**

 

Prigozhin died in a plane crash near Moscow Aug. 23, according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-prigozhin-plane-crash-may-have-been-caused-deliberately-2023-08-30/). Since his death, social media users have been sharing a video claiming that BBC News reported that Prigozhin was actually still alive.

There is no evidence that the BBC created this video.

Check Your Fact reviewed BBC’s [website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/search?q=prigozhin&d=NEWS_GNL) and did not find any articles or videos reporting that Prigozhin was still alive. A review of the organization’s X accounts, such as [@BBCBreaking](https://twitter.com/BBCBreaking) and [@BBCWorld](https://twitter.com/BBCWorld), also did not yield any results for the alleged video. A [wider internet search](https://www.google.com/search?q=bbc+news+prigozhin+still+alive&oq=bbc+news+prigozhin+still+alive&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61.3569j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) also did not yield any results for such a report.

 

A BBC spokesperson told Check Your Fact they were “aware of this fake video.”

“We are aware of this fake video and our lawyers are urgently looking into it. In a world of increasing disinformation, we urge everyone to check links and URLs to ensure they are getting news from a trusted source,” the spokesperson said.

BBC Verify reporter Shayan Sardarizadeh also [debunked](https://twitter.com/Shayan86/status/1696625204552671413) the claim in a tweet. **[(RELATED: Did Jared Kushner Delete All Of His Tweets After The New York Times Story On Donald Trump’s Tax Returns?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2020/09/28/fact-check-jared-kushner-delete-tweets-nyt-trump-tax-returns/)**

  
“A fake video with the logo and branding of BBC News is being shared online, claiming that Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin’s death was staged by the Kremlin. The video is completely fake. BBC News has never published such a video,” Sardarizadeh tweeted.

The [account](https://twitter.com/GeromanAT/status/1696625959389028605) that spread the claim acknowledged that the video was fake in a reply to another user but refused to take it down. The original tweet has a Community Notes [attached](https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch/n/1696549578424697002) to it, noting that the fake BBC News video has not appeared on any BBC sources.

Fake BBC News videos about the Russian-Ukrainian war are not new. Check Your Fact [debunked](https://checkyourfact.com/2022/04/13/fact-check-bbc-news-report-kramatorsk-attack/) a video in 2022 claiming to show a BBC News report saying that Ukraine was responsible for a missile strike that killed 50 civilians in Kramatorsk.
