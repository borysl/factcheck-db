A post [shared on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClgnDOVuUlZ/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=b7b8b305-2775-4c7c-9254-e5c9c7992177) purports thousands of children were rescued from a property owned by President Joe Biden in Ukraine.

  
**Verdict: False**

 

There is no evidence suggesting any children have been rescued from Biden’s properties. There is also no evidence suggesting Biden himself owns any properties in Ukraine.

**Fact Check:**

The Biden administration is weighing a Ukrainian request for access to a U.S. stockpile containing cluster munition warheads, according to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/politics/ukraine-cluster-munitions-us-war-russia/index.html). The U.S. House of Representatives also passed a defense bill that would grant more aid to Ukraine and Taiwan, [Defense News](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2022/12/08/house-passes-defense-bill-with-more-taiwan-ukraine-security-aid/) reported.

 

The Instagram post, which features a screenshot of a news article, purports thousands of children were rescued from a Biden-owned property in Ukraine. “BREAKING NEWS: Thousands of Children Rescued, Mutilated Bodies Recovered, From Biden-Owned Ukraine Property,” the article’s headline reads.

The claim is false. There are [no credible news reports](https://www.google.com/search?q=BREAKING+NEWS%3A+Thousands+of+Children+Rescued%2C+Mutilated+Bodies+Recovered%2C+From+Biden-Owned+Ukraine+Property&oq=BREAKING+NEWS%3A+Thousands+of+Children+Rescued%2C+Mutilated+Bodies+Recovered%2C+From+Biden-Owned+Ukraine+Property&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2.399j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) suggesting thousands of children were rescued from a Biden-owned property in Ukraine. Likewise, the White House has neither mentioned the claim on its [website](https://www.whitehouse.gov/?s=BREAKING+NEWS%3A+Thousands+of+Children+Rescued%2C+Mutilated+Bodies+Recovered%2C+From+Biden-Owned+Ukraine+Property) nor on its verified [social](https://www.facebook.com/profile/100069123883596/search?q=BREAKING%20NEWS%3A%20Thousands%20of%20Children%20Rescued%2C%20Mutilated%20Bodies%20Recovered%2C%20From%20Biden-Owned%20Ukraine%20Property&filters=eyJycF9jcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lOjAiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJjcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lXCIsXCJhcmdzXCI6XCJ7XFxcInN0YXJ0X3llYXJcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIyXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIyLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfeWVhclxcXCI6XFxcIjIwMjJcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIyLTEyXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMi0xLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMi0xMi0zMVxcXCJ9XCJ9IiwicnBfY2hyb25vX3NvcnQ6MCI6IntcIm5hbWVcIjpcImNocm9ub3NvcnRcIixcImFyZ3NcIjpcIlwifSJ9) [media](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22BREAKING%20NEWS%3A%20Thousands%20of%20Children%20Rescued%2C%20Mutilated%20Bodies%20Recovered%2C%20From%20Biden-Owned%20Ukraine%20Property%22%20\(from%3AWhiteHouse\)%20lang%3Aen&src=typed_query) [accounts](https://www.instagram.com/whitehouse/). Biden also [has not publicly commented](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22BREAKING%20NEWS%3A%20Thousands%20of%20Children%20Rescued%2C%20Mutilated%20Bodies%20Recovered%2C%20From%20Biden-Owned%20Ukraine%20Property%22%20\(from%3APOTUS\)%20lang%3Aen&src=typed_query) on the purported claim. The State Department also has not released any [statements](https://www.state.gov/united-with-ukraine/releases/) on the claims.

A keyword search reveals the claim stems from an [April 22 article](https://thetruedefender.com/breaking-news-thousands-of-children-rescued-mutilated-bodies-recovered-from-biden-owned-ukraine-property/) published by The True Defender. The article further claims both the children and mutilated bodies were found by the Russian military in underground tunnels that run beneath a 200-acre property owned by Biden in Ukraine that also connects to bioweapons labs.

 

The article appears to be based on an [April 6 article](https://beforeitsnews.com/politics/2022/04/thousands-of-children-rescued-mutilated-bodies-recovered-from-biden-owned-ukraine-property-containing-us-run-bio-weapon-labs-3259889.html) from the website, Before It’s News, which made similar claims. Neither of the articles links to any evidence substantiating the claims. **[(RELATED: Does This Video Show Joe Biden Wearing A ‘Mao Suit’ To Meet The Chinese President?)](https://checkyourfact.com/2022/11/21/fact-check-joe-biden-mao-suit/)**

Both the purported claim that Biden owns property in Ukraine and that the U.S. funds bioweapons laboratories in Ukraine have been debunked by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-biden-ukraine-children/fact-check-no-evidence-children-were-rescued-from-joe-biden-owned-property-in-ukraine-idUSL1N32W19W) and [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/60711705), respectively.
