**Verdict: False**

The video does show a Ukrainian Challenger 2 tank, according to multiple media outlets and independent analysts. The United Kingdom Defense Secretary confirmed the Challenger 2 tank was destroyed.

**Fact Check:**

 

Ukraine is continuing its offensive in the south, making gains around the village of Verbove and trying to punch through Russia‚Äôs defensive lines, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/world/europe/ukraine-counteroffensive-zelensky.html). A video of a destroyed Challenger 2 tank began circulating on social media, with some social media users stating that the video‚Äôs caption was inaccurate. **[(RELATED: Russia Today Headline Claiming Prigozhin‚Äôs Pilot Had Post-Vaccine Myocarditis Is Fabricated)](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/09/01/fact-check-russia-today-prigozhins-pilot-myocarditis/)**

However, the video does show a Ukrainian Challenger 2 tank. Multiple media outlets, such as [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/05/british-challenger-2-tank-destroyed-in-combat-for-first-time-ukraine-footage-shows) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-05/first-ever-challenger-2-tank-destroyed-by-enemy-fire-in-ukraine), reported that the tank was indeed a Challenger 2. Furthermore, independent analysts such as [Oryx Blog](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-ukrainian.html), a website that tracks military equipment losses in the Russian-Ukrainian War, and [UA Weapons Tracker](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1698955326496592140) stated that the tank was a Challenger 2.

  
A ‚ÄúWestern defense source‚Äù told [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66716788) that the tank was hit by a mine, forcing the crew to abandon the tank before being destroyed by a Russian Lancet loitering munition. U.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed to [Sky News](https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1699310387978514818?s=20) that the Challenger 2 tank was destroyed in Ukraine and said it was hit by artillery.

 

Misinformation around the Russian-Ukrainian war is not new. Check Your Fact recently [debunked](https://checkyourfact.com/2023/09/05/fact-check-video-putin-prigozhins-funeral/) a video claiming to show Russian President Vladimir Putin at Wagner Group founder Yevengy Prigozhin‚Äôs funeral.
