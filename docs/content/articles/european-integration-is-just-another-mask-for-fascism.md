DISINFO: European integration is just another mask for fascism
==============================================================

### SUMMARY

The European Union has been taking the fight into its own hands since May 9 in Moldova - this is exactly what the new plan for the celebration of 'Europe Day' looks like. Definitely in the central square, certainly with the city blocked off due to the arrival of an 'important guest' and certainly on May 9th. This is a requirement of the EU Delegation, and it will, of course, be fulfilled. (...) However, normal people have long since figured out that 'European integration' is just another mask for fascism.

### RESPONSE

The claim refers to the decision by Moldovan authorities to celebrate Europe Day in Chisinau on May 9 this year. Previously, the celebration was organized on a different day to avoid overlapping with those who celebrate the Soviet Union's victory in the Second World War on May 9.

The [announcement](https://www.facebook.com/maia.sandu/posts/pfbid02oUm7qBMHqcMqCSYSUjUZvSfB7nLSpHXWXnBR9tqgep2nJEChtBp65QfC3GES1vSrl) was made by Moldovan President Maia Sandu, who mentioned that the event is organised by the Government of the Republic of Moldova in collaboration with the Delegation of the European Union in Moldova, and not _at the request_ of the Delegation, as erroneously stated in the claim.

The baseless accusation of fascism is one of the preferred labels of pro-Kremlin propaganda for powers, governments or institutions Moscow considers hostile to Russia, including the European Union, as shown in our analyses [here](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/always-blame-the-west-and-six-other-disinformation-trends/) and [here](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/key-narratives-in-pro-kremlin-disinformation-nazis/).
